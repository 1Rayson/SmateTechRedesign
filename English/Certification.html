        <p>
            Certification need to be planned early in the NPI process to avoid delays and trouble during compliance
            testing. Take advantage of our experience and close connection with SGS in Shenzhen who provides very
            cost-effective certification services for a wide range of fields and countries, such as CE, FCC, IC, CCC,
            battery-related safety certification, material testing, IP-rating and RF tests.

            Doing certification in Shenzhen typically cost a fraction of European test labs due to high competition,
            lower labour costs, and very high throughput of products.
            The key is close cooperation, early risk assessment and pre-testing by renting labs per hour.

        <p>
            When you are not certain that you can pass the tests, we recommend you to run trail test for, e.g EMC, RF,
            if the orientation test passes, it will not be tested again for the complete product.

        <h2>Pre-test</h2>
        <p>
            >Pre-test examples: 200 point 3D antenna pattern measurement, absolute power and harmonics, IP-rating,
            material tests
            e.g. metal surface treatment and contamination + layer thickness

            SGS and we will advise on preparation, how to test and what is needed besides functioning
            prototypes.
